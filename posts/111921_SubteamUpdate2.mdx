## Structures

Recently, the structures team received the shipment of Halcyon's flight COPV (composite overwrapped pressure vessel) liners. This is **huge**! It means that they have officially shifted from developmental testing to manufacturing & testing flight hardware. Moreover, the team has also resumed skirt production for Halcyon, kicking it off with two skirts using lighter carbon fiber.  Without the material testing done beforehand, this would not have been possible (so congrats!). Something also interesting that happened was this quote from structures systems engineer Ray Tin:

What will happen within the next few weeks is that, with the new shipment, the team will wrap the flight liners up in carbon fiber and begin conducting a comprehensive testing campaign. Additionally, the hold downs (HD) team will also continue to pump out spicy memes and make fantastic CADs and ANSYS simulations. 
 
## Fluid Systems

Reflecting on the past three weeks, the fluid systems (FS) team has hit numerous milestones. First, they redesigned the FW (Flight Weight) system to satisfy the mass requirement by cutting out a ton of components. Second, their GSE (ground support equipment) team passed their RP-1 MRR (Rocket Propellant-1 Manufacturing Readiness Review). And third, the QD (Quick Disconnect) team passed their CDR (Critical Design Review). But that’s not all! Because in addition to all of those impressive things, they’ve also accomplished a plethora of other tasks. Tasks such as receiving quotes from different companies for a significant number of components after sizing those components with simulations and calculations, speccing out virtually every fitting, and beginning to plan their orders for everything needed for FW and GSE. 
 
At the moment, QD is working on a test stand to test the separation system. For GSE, they are working on building their RP-1 line and passing MRR for the other lines. Ultimately, however, the team has made a lot of progress in creating simulations for every line in the rocket. Examining previous calculations and coming up with better numbers and functional requirements, they hope to produce even more accurate simulations in the future.
