Beginning Nov. 10, TREL will participate in its first-ever HornRaiser event. Through the funds raised, TREL hopes to be able to complete projects such as running major manufacturing and test campaigns, purchasing major flight components, performing end-to-end testing of those major flight components, along with a slew of others. Moreover, the tier-based donation system incorporated into the HornRaiser page will also provide donors with the opportunity to be featured on the TREL website donor wall in addition to having gifts such as member-signed Halcyon stickers and dedicated Halcyon components delivered to their front door too. 

## One Whole Month of Raisin’ Money!

Throughout the month-long donation process (stretching from Nov. 10 to Dec. 10), TREL will plan out several emails and social media posts aimed at encouraging supporters to share the HornRaiser page with their family and friends. In those emails and social media posts, not only will TREL vocalize its mission as a university-based rocket lab aimed at training and educating future rocket engineers, but ones that also help educate a future generation, too. Moreover, it will also include snippets of TREL’s outreach program teaching and inspiring children of all ages (from elementary to high school).

If you believe in TREL’s mission (as stated above), you too can participate in our HornRaiser process. As an ambassador, you can help us share our HornRaiser page, and as a donor, you can help contribute to our projects (whether they be educational, technical, etc.).
