Last month, the Hotfire team conducted a LOX Cold Flow test on the pintle of the TXE-2 engine. Not only is this their first test of the semester, but it kicks off a series of hardware tests that will be run on the new engine. The team overcame several blockers to reach this first milestone, and has been working very hard to revamp and prepare the test stand for the upcoming rounds of testing.

Through this test, the Hotfire team was able to characterize hydraulic resistance, the LOX priming time, and trace the temperature of the pintle inlet. The data collected will be used to inform future work on the injector, determine tank set pressures to hit nominal flow rate, and to ultimately determine the start sequence for the engine hotfire later this fall.

Upcoming, the Hotfire team will prepare to conduct a RP-1 Cold Flow to qualify the combustion chamber's regen channels and generate the engine timing sequences. They have also begun work on the Igniter tests.

The success of the LOX Cold Flow test was a culmination of hard work from many TREL members under Ben Juegner and Zachary Hestand's leadership. A big shout out to the test crew - congratulations on all of your hard work!
