Hot Fire would like to give a big shout-out to their new team member, Gabe Bishop, who has been working on tube fabrication and box installation during the past couple of weeks while learning about the inner workings of the test stand. Over those weeks, he has also made his love for Kanye, minions, and zip-ties abundantly clear.

## A few photos from the past two months
