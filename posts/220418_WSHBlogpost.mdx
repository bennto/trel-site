TREL did not go unnoticed at the launch of the What Starts Here campaign on March 4th. This event was the biggest fundraising campaign in UTâ€™s history, meant to lend support to and encourage UT's researchers. Our lab, members, and mission made an incredible impact in showcasing the drive and ambition of UT students, showing off our 30-foot-tall rocket in the middle of the EER.

The mockup is a tangible indicator for the reality of TREL's mission and reflects the progress of our lab and community since our inception. A huge round of applause to everyone who tirelessly put the mockup together!
