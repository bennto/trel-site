Are you interested to see what TREL accomplishes within a given month or week? Well, this is the place for you! In each subteam update blog post, teams are given the opportunity to share with you both recent milestones and funny things that happened while working. And ultimately, we hope that you -- whether youâ€™re a future applicant, family member or friend, or sponsor -- will enjoy reading these.

Best regards,
TREL

## Reaction Control Systems (RCS)

First off, a huge congratulations to the Reaction Control Systems (RCS) subteam for completing a number of tasks this past month. During this past month, they validated and evaluated nozzle design through several testing campaigns, in addition to iterating and developing new components and system designs based on test results. Moreover, they have also been working on integrating with fluids and structural systems.

Overall, though, the RCS test and design team has been consistently on top of their game. Something that's been seen through them "knocking things out when they need to or even before." This has allowed RCS to finish testing and most analyses and design iteration in barely over a month, keeping them on track to finish before the spring!

Future goals for them include looking at control algorithms and other control integrations with fins. Also, they plan to continue working with other teams to integrate.

## Payload

After a change in mission objectives shifted the payload's focus, the payload team began wrapping up redesigns. This past month, the team successfully passed Preliminary Design Reviews (PDR) for their recovery and fluids subsystems. The recovery system ensures the payload is recoverable to review collected data, while the fluids system is responsible for inflating a balloon upon descent. Members of the lab were able to attend a meeting, providing feedback on the designs of the subsystems and the next steps for these subsystems.

The team would like to extend special thanks to the recovery team's Katy Mueller and fluids team's Josue Caballero and Daniel Young for their hard work in these subsystem redesigns!

To finalize designs, the recovery team and fluids team will begin prototyping! The remaining subsystems will be scheduling their PDR  in the coming weeks. After every subsystem has passed their PDRs and finished prototyping, a joint Critical Design Review will be held over the payload system as a whole.

## Propulsion

Since the start of the semester, the propulsion team has been busy making TREL's TXE-2 flight engine a reality! After completing a successful Critical Design Review of our system, the team has entered the manufacturing, testing, and iteration phase. Manufacturing has begun on all propulsion components, post-processing pipelines have been developed for the additively manufactured copper alloy combustion chamber, and the next iteration of flight engine designs has also begun. With each task, there will be a focus on increasing performance, manufacturing, and mass efficiency. Test plans and configurations, assembly instructions, and Concept of Operations (CONOPS) are also currently being finalized so that the team can rapidly and efficiently transfer to hotfire testing once manufacturing is completed!

The team also wants to share a shout-out regarding Chase Holder for leading the analysis campaign effort, Evan Kolderup for overhauling the TXE-2 chamber CAD, Chase Meech for his upgraded injector SN3 design, and Phillip DuPont for leading the extended FMEA for TXE-2 operation. The new Propulsion team members Maritza, Lipika, Blake, Luciana, and Aditya also get a shout-out for jumping right into TREL, taking ownership over their projects, and getting the team to hotfire!

Moving forward, the propulsion team is looking to start printing and post-processing the copper alloy combustion chamber, continue practicing assemblies using their 1:1 scale mockup, finalize test plans and risk mitigation, and prepare for hotfire testing.
