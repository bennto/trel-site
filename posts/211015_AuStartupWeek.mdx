Just last Wednesday, Oct. 6, TREL delivered its first public presentation of the year at Austin Startup Week. Hosted by Amazon Web Services, high-profile business leaders and corporations from around the world tuned in live to see what TREL had to say about being one of the most advanced collegiate rocket organizations in the country.

## Presentation Time!

Chief engineer Lauren Rodriguez, who was given the task to present the Halcyon rocket to the audience (along with corporate development leads Adam Norwitz and Greg Gaasche), explained that the most difficult part of the presentation was “trying to figure out what level of detail [she] needed to provide to get [her] point across.” A task she accomplished by considering who her audience exactly was throughout the entirety of the presentation and trying to communicate to them in an effective way.

“I tried to emphasize Halcyon’s projects and their complexity the most -- we learn so much from our challenges, so talking about the vehicle really drives home what an incredible opportunity being a part of TREL is,” Rodriguez said.

## Happy Hour

After the presentation, TREL was given the opportunity to attend Austin Startup Week’s “Happy Hour”. An event that made it possible for TREL to connect with a myriad of companies, business leaders, and those wanting to innovate in the space industry.

“Happy Hour was another incredible opportunity for TREL. We were finally able to meet our friends at AWS in person, as well as many other companies making an impact in the space industry,” Norwitz said. “TREL hopes to partner with more space companies from Texas to help us in inspiring the next generation of aerospace pioneers.”

Ultimately, the event for TREL proved to be a success. And with it getting its name out as an organization that both builds complex rockets and educates the next generation about aerospace, TREL hopes to continue its legacy for years to come.

“Kudos to @Gregory Gaasche, @Adam Norwitz, and @Lauren Rodriguez for a fantastic presentation to AWS Wednesday,” director Sandy Barker said while congratulating the trio on Slack. “I've gotten fabulous feedback from attendees, volunteers to come speak with us, and an invitation for TREL AWS to join their space forum. This will provide opportunities for years to come. Please join me in congratulating them!”
