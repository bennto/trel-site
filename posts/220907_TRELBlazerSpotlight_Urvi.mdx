## Urvi Alamela
### Director of Operations

This month’s TRELBlazer is Urvi Alamela! Urvi’s consistent commitment to TREL is something to be admired. As an admin, although her job is time pertinent, it doesn't hamper her ability to juggle all her responsibilities in TREL and school. Urvi is an incredible asset to TREL, pushing past the title of her job to help wherever needed. Her passion shone through as she recently helped organize TREL’s recruitment cycle; it would not have been such a great success without her! Urvi continuously exemplifies our Social Contract through all that she does. We appreciate the hard work and long hours she has dedicated to this lab and we can’t wait to see what amazing things she’ll do next!
