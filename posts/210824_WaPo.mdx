## This. Is. Awesome.

Great news! The Washington Post Creative Group did a piece over the summer on TREL. In it, they highlight our director of test operations, Jason Deng (neat!), in addition to all of the other incredible aspects of TREL (our synopsis, engine, our first hot-fire test, etc.) The story itself is incredibly interactive with all sorts of cool visual effects and videos, so we recommend you check it out yourself!
