On Sept. 24, UT President Jay Hartzell delivered his inaugural speech, promising to both cultivate the diversity of the student body as well as move UT up the ranks in academics. In addition to that, he also mentioned TREL when discussing how UT could have a “greater impact by pulling together great people in this special place and pursuing the right things.” In the short snippet of the speech, he included how staff such as Sarah Kitten (an academic advisor here at UT) was able to help create this remarkable organization by connecting former TREL CEO and director of operations Shawn Lee to the lab in the first place.

## Our Snippet

To read the entire part of the speech discussing TREL, you can see it below:

“Let me give you an example. Shawn Lee graduated in May from the Cockrell School. As a freshman, he connected with the Texas Rocket Engineering Lab, or TREL for short. They’re a student group developing the first collegiate liquid bipropellant rocket to reach the Kármán line — the boundary between Earth’s atmosphere and outer space. That’s a pretty awesome project, right? About like what we did when we were in college?

It was Shawn’s academic adviser, Sarah Kitten, who connected him to the lab. A faculty member and TREL’s director at the time, Dr. Leon Vanstone, soon became Shawn’s mentor. These experiences didn’t just provide Shawn with knowledge. They taught him how to build cool teams as well as cool stuff. Shawn went on to mentor other students and eventually served as TREL’s CEO and director of operations. He interned at Blue Origin, a rocket and spacecraft company with the mission of building a road to space. Shawn now works for them full time. With people and stories like these, we’ve joked that we may need to change our tagline to ‘What starts here changes the universe.’”
