Last month on March 5th, TREL was given the exciting opportunity to showcase its progress in the TEDxUTAustin 2022 Blueprints event. The event's goal was to inspire others to create and innovate by showcasing the beginnings and progress of large projects. TREL was a perfect fit for this and were able to highlight the lab's progress on Halcyon to other current and potential innovators.

At our table, we showed off pieces of designs from various parts of the lab: a skirt, the nosecone, TXE-2, heatsink, and a COPV dome.
