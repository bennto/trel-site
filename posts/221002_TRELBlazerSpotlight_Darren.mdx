This month’s TRELBlazer is Darren Au! Joining TREL in Fall 2021, he worked on GNC and Fluids before eventually beginning work on TVC. Coming into the lab as a freshman, Darren had little technical experience in FEAs or SolidWorks but was guided by several members of the lab throughout his time here to find his niche on a system that had both mechanical and software components. He was very passionate about TVC and remained the sole member for the team throughout all Controls System Discussions. Darren would like to share that he is incredibly grateful for everyone’s help, open-mindedness, and for the belief that they had in him and the TVC system. We appreciate all his hard work and cannot wait to see TVC when it is tested!
