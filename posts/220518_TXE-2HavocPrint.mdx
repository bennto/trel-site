TREL was originally founded to compete in the Base 11 competition. The mission of the competition was to encourage an increased representation of inclusion for women and minorities in STEM, while attempting to launch the first collegiate liquid bipropellant rocket a hundred kilometers to the Karman line for a prize of $1 million. Due to extenuating circumstances with Covid this challenge has since been canceled. Nevertheless, TREL is still aiming for the stars, and plans to continue pushing the limits of science and rocketry and achieve this feat regardless of the monetary reward being removed. Elementum 3D and EOS North America have partnered with TREL to push the limits of science and rocketry with the inclusion of additive manufacturing, printer technology and advanced materials. Our partners, EOS and Elementum 3D, have been an incredibly valuable asset in helping TREL take major strides towards accomplishing our project of Halcyon. With their help we’ve recently been able to 3D print our rocket engine.

By using 3D printing we are able to have a single piece combustion chamber helping guarantee less points of failure, special geometries to optimize regen channels for max cooling with minimal pressure drop, a greatly simplified manufacturing process, unique design capabilities, and it has allowed for us to have a special injector design, making this print potentially the most efficient collegiate rocket engine! The chamber is made up of a copper alloy to withstand high chamber pressure and is designed to be fully reusable, as well as be able to support up to 60 second fire durations. With our engine in hand, TREL will continue to shoot for the stars, and with the progress made so far, it won’t be long now before we’re ready for lift-off!
