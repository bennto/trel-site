Hello to anyone reading! I guess you're here to learn how to write and format some articles? Well you've come to the right place! Below, you will find how to insert special elements (eg. images, links) and some common ways you might want to format your articles (eg. bold, headers).

## File Header

Articles can be written in any basic notepad and file names ought to end with the .mdx file extension. If you look at the .mdx file for _this_ article, you'll find that several lines are written at the top, describing the title, date, author, and picture. These are essential and used in the blog index to distinguish blog posts from one another.

## Special Elements

^ This is a picture. The file path is in the ( round brackets ) and the picture's nickname is in the [ boxy brackets ].

This is a [link](/donate). The word that you click on to get to the link is in the [ boxy brackets ] and the link path is in the ( round brackets ). Our website has special link routing, (eg. the facilities page is /facilities) but if you want to route to external links, you do so normally (eg. google.com)

PM me if you have any quirky things you want to be able to add in articles.

- list item 1
- list item 2

This is a paragraph with a **bold item** inside. It's hard to notice tho, might be better to use _emphasis_ instead?
